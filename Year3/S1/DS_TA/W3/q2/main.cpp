 * Tower of Hanoi
 * 
 * @Description
 * Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
 * 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * 2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
 * 3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
 * 
 * There are only 3 rods "A", "B" and "C", you need to move all the disks from rod "A" to rod "C" and print the minimum number of moves required to complete the question.
 * 
 * Note: You must use your own "Stack" class, no recursive function can be used and no formula like 2^N-1 can be used, or you will get up to 0 points.
 * 
 * @Input Description
 * The number of the disks on the rod "A", ends up with line-break or end-of-file.
 * 
 * @Output Description
 * The minimum number of moves required, ending with a "\n" of each line
