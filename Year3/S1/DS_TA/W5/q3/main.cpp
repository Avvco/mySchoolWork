/**
 * Expression Tree
 * 
 * @Description:
 * Please replace the class "Stack" with the class "BinarySearchTree" to redo the question "Arithmetic II".
 * All the rules are the same as the Arithmetic problem, except there are no parentheses.
 * Serialize and deserialize rules are the same as the question "Binary Search Tree II".
 * You need to deserialize the string with levelorder traversal and then read the expression tree with inorder traversal.
 * You can add any function or variable if you want.
 * You must use your own class "BinarySearchTree" you wrote or you will get up to 0 points.
 * 
 * @Input Description
 * A serialized string that represents the expression tree.
 *  
 * 
 * @Output Description
 * Result of the expression tree to the 2nd decimal place, "ERROR" when operation error, ending with a "\n" of each line
